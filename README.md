# Jamie_Oliver_tribute_page

ðŸ‘‰As part of my learning before starting the course with the School of Code, I created a simple, static webpage about my food hero Jamie Oliver! Through utilising HTML & CSS I created a simple clean design which showcased an added image, a link to an external resource, different fonts, an unordered list and a footer.
Please bare in mind that I literally had no coding experience at this point ðŸ˜‚ but I can look back on this with fond memories and see how much I have progressed in the future.

Thanks for stopping by!
